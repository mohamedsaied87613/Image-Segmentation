# Image-Segmentation
creators : mohamed saied hassan _ mohamed hassan oraby

Problem Statement :
We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can 
group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The 
grouping problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on 
the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark. Below we will show the needed steps to 
achieve the goal of the assignment.
